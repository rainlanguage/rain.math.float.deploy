/// @notice Every version published to the soldeer registry for
/// `rain-math-float-deploy` must have a full suite of pinned deploy constants in
/// `LibDecimalFloatDeploy`: a log-tables address + codehash and a DecimalFloat
/// address + codehash for each published version.
///
/// `script/check-published-deploy-constants.sh` splits that into a structural
/// half (every version suffix carrying any pinned constant carries all four —
/// pure file inspection) and a registry half (every published version is
/// pinned — needs api.soldeer.xyz). The structural half is asserted
/// unconditionally here, so a run that cannot reach the registry still verifies
/// something real rather than verifying nothing.
///
/// The registry half is asserted unconditionally too, by handing the script a
/// fixture in place of a fetched response. That keeps three things off the
/// network: that a published version with no pinned suite is reported, that the
/// version scan reads a response whatever whitespace it carries, and that a
/// response no version can be read out of is a failure rather than the skip an
/// unreachable registry earns.
