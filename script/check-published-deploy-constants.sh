# Checks that the per-version deploy constants pinned in LibDecimalFloatDeploy.sol
# are complete. Each published version needs a full suite: a log-tables address +
# codehash and a DecimalFloat address + codehash, each suffixed with the version
# (dots replaced by underscores).
#
# Two halves, split by what they depend on:
#
#   1. STRUCTURAL (offline). Every version suffix that carries any pinned
#      constant must carry all four. Catches a half-written release snapshot.
#      Pure file inspection, so it is deterministic and always runs.
#   2. REGISTRY (online). Every version published to the soldeer registry must
#      carry a pinned suite, so publishing a tag without pinning its constants
#      is caught. Needs api.soldeer.xyz.
#
# Usage:
#   check-published-deploy-constants.sh [--lib <path>] [--offline]
#
#   --lib <path>  file to inspect (default src/lib/deploy/LibDecimalFloatDeploy.sol)
#   --offline     run the structural half only, and never touch the network.
#                 Lets a test assert the structural half deterministically
#                 instead of depending on whether the registry answered.
#
# Consumed by LibDecimalFloatDeployTaggedConstants.t.sol via FFI. Output is one
# of:
#   OK                   - every half that ran, passed
#   MISSING: <names...>  - one or more expected constants are absent
#   SKIP: <reason>       - default mode only: the structural half passed but the
#                          registry was unreachable, so that half did not run
#
# Always exits 0 so the test sees the message rather than an ffi failure.
