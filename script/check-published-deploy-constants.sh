# Prints "OK" iff every version published to the soldeer registry for
# `rain-math-float-deploy` has a full suite of pinned deploy constants in
# LibDecimalFloatDeploy.sol: a log-tables address + codehash and a DecimalFloat
# address + codehash, each suffixed with the version.

# Consumed by LibDecimalFloatDeployTaggedConstants.t.sol via FFI. Output is one

#   OK                   - every published version has its full constant suite
#   MISSING: <names...>  - one or more expected constants are absent
#   SKIP: <reason>       - the registry could not be reached (nothing verified)
#
# Always exits 0 so the test sees the message rather than an ffi failure.
