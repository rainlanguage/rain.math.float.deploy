# Checks that the per-version deploy constants pinned in LibDecimalFloatDeploy.sol
# are complete. Each published version needs a full suite: a log-tables address +
# codehash and a DecimalFloat address + codehash, each suffixed with the version
# (dots replaced by underscores).
#
# Two halves, split by what they depend on:
#
#   1. STRUCTURAL (offline). Every version suffix that carries any pinned
#      constant must carry all four. Catches a half-written release snapshot.
#      Pure file inspection, so it is deterministic and always runs.
#   2. REGISTRY (online). Every version published to the soldeer registry must
#      carry a pinned suite, so publishing a tag without pinning its constants
#      is caught. Needs api.soldeer.xyz.
#
# Usage:
#   check-published-deploy-constants.sh [--lib <path>] [--offline]
#                                       [--registry-response <path>]
#
#   --lib <path>  file to inspect (default src/lib/deploy/LibDecimalFloatDeploy.sol)
#   --offline     run the structural half only, and never touch the network.
#                 Lets a test assert the structural half deterministically
#                 instead of depending on whether the registry answered.
#   --registry-response <path>
#                 use the contents of <path> as the registry response instead
#                 of fetching one, so a test can drive the registry half
#                 deterministically. Stands in for a fetch that SUCCEEDED;
#                 there is no stand-in for one that failed, because that path
#                 is what every offline CI run already takes.
#
# Consumed by LibDecimalFloatDeployTaggedConstants.t.sol via FFI. Output is one
# of:
#   OK                     - every half that ran, passed
#   MISSING: <names...>    - one or more expected constants are absent
#   SKIP: <reason>         - default mode only: the structural half passed but
#                            the registry could not be fetched, so that half
#                            did not run
#   UNREADABLE: <reason>   - the registry answered and no version could be read
#                            out of the answer. A failure, not a skip: see the
#                            registry half below for why.
#
# Always exits 0 so the test sees the message rather than an ffi failure.

# the branch that reports SKIP — so a change in the registry's response shape
# would silently disable this half forever while every run stayed green.
#
# A fetch that fails is a SKIP: the endpoint 404s for a project with no
# published revisions, which is the state this repo is in until the first
# `sol-v*` tag publishes, and a network that is simply down is not a finding.
#
# A fetch that SUCCEEDS and yields no version is UNREADABLE, and that is a
# failure. This endpoint only answers 2xx for a project that exists, and a
# project exists on the registry because it has revisions; so a readable 2xx
# always carries at least one `"version"`. Zero of them means the response no
# longer looks the way this script reads it.
